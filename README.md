# Brick-Breaker
A game developed for GameDev Hackathon conducted by DevCom, WnCC, IITB

## Levels
Currently, the game has 5 levels. The player has to break all the bricks to win the game. Controls and other features of the game are well-explained in instructions page.

If the player loses at some level, by clicking on play again button, the player can start from that level but the score would become zero.

## Controls
To move the paddle, the player can either use **"A" and "D"** keys or **up and down arrows**. The same keys can be used to change the direction in which the player wants to throw the ball if the ball is caught.
When the ball is caught, the player can shoot the ball using **spacebar** or **up arrow key** or **"D"**.

These options are the ones that can be used by the player by pressing key-board buttons or on-screen buttons. These can be used once every level. Their effect ends after 10 seconds. These include the following:
* **Slow Ball**: It can be activated by pressing "S" key on keyboard or clicking corresponding button in right panel.
* **Fast Paddle**: It can be activated by pressing "F" key on keyboard or clicking corresponding button in right panel.
